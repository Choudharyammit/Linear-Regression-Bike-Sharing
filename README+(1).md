## General Information

- **Project Background**: BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced significant revenue declines due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The company aims to understand the future demand for shared bikes post-pandemic to adapt and thrive in the market.
- **Business Problem**: The project seeks to identify which variables significantly predict the demand for shared bikes and how well these variables describe bike demand. This understanding will help BoomBikes adjust its business strategy to meet customer demand and maximize profits.
- **Dataset**: The dataset includes various independent variables that could influence bike demand, such as weather conditions, seasonal information, and day-specific factors.

## Conclusions

- **Conclusion 1**: The demand for bikes is significantly influenced by the year and whether it is a working day.
- **Conclusion 2**: Temperature and wind speed are crucial predictors of bike demand.
- **Conclusion 3**: Specific months like September and days like Saturday show higher demand.
- **Conclusion 4**: Weather conditions, such as light snow/rain and mist, along with seasons like summer and winter, also affect bike-sharing demand.

## Technologies Used

- **warnings**: Library for managing warning messages.
- **numpy**: Version 1.0, used for numerical computations.
- **pandas**: Version 1.2, used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **matplotlib**: Version 3.3, used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **seaborn**: Version 0.11, used for statistical data visualization.
- **statsmodels**: Version 0.12, used for estimating and interpreting various statistical models.
